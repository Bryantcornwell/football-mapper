Professional sports industries continue to increase their reliance upon analytics, one of the primary being the tracking of player movement. In football (soccer) this is even more prioritized as the game relies upon player positioning and movement on a vast playing surface. Modern techniques utilize wearable technology to accomplish this. This paper argues that through the adaptation of existing computer vision techniques the same results can be achieved and democratized. Utilizing image channel thresholding, Hough Transformations, algebra, linear algebra, and a deep neural network, our results illustrate the possibilities of transforming player and ball locations from broadcast images into a 2-dimensional overhead coordinate space.
