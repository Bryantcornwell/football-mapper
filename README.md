# football-mapper
Project to create 2-d minimap representation of football (soccer) games.

# Project Description
Most sport broadcasts camera angles provide views from the sides of the playing field but tracking players can be difficult as the camera and views change. Having an additional real-time tracking, overhead view of the field could provide an easier way to study player performances and other game statistics. Our group is interested in using computer vision techniques to recognize football (soccer) objects and mapping the movements into an overhead 2-D space for further event recognition during gameplay. This would involve collecting still images to train an image recognition algorithm for the players, ball, and other related objects. The algorithm can then be used to track object movement in the video. This movement can then be translated to a 2-D overhead space, which can be used to track game progress and events from an overhead view.

- Identify Objects in still image

- Classify objects in still image

- Track object movement in video

- Translate tracking to 2d space*

- Recognize events in the game*
